# Summarymd

**V2.0.0 is a new version, the previous interface is no longer supported!!! [中文Readme](README.zh-CN.md)**

> Gitbook wasn't used much before, but it turned out that summarymd implemented functions similar to Gitbook `init` command.

Summymd can:

1. Summymd makes the process of creating files controllable and customizable.

    * You can decide which header to use —— you can use "*", "=", custom YAML headers, etc.

        > YAML headers cannot be parsed accurately (this module relies on markdown-it to parse markdown). This affects the accuracy of creating temporary directories. Unless you add a markdown tag after the YAML header that resolves to `h1 >... < H1 >`.

    * Instead of just creating an empty document with a title like Gitbook, you can add some specific text content in batches.

2. Summymd makes the way to generate directory lists controllable.

    * Variable Link Text - You can use the file name as the link text, regardless of the title of the article;

    * Version v2.0.0+ supports indentation based on matching specific characters (whether characters in paths or titles are matched by regular expressions), ignoring the nesting relationship of folders. This facilitates the grouping of documents with similar or related content.

    * Supports folder indentation once per level (default indentation).

    > Indentation is used to make it easier to sort out the order of documents ——for those documents that are not included in the summary list file, you need to manually adjust the order of documents before they are included, and then manually append them to the real summary file (such as `summary.md`). (The summary list generated by this package is only a temporary markdown file with the default file name: `"_summary.md"`.

3. Print Problems with lists in `SUMMARY.md`:

    * File paths that do not exist (original files are deleted, moved, renamed, empty paths, or inaccurate paths, of course, may not have been created), but `SUMMARY.md` did not modify or create the file.

    * No text links. For example: `[](doc/example.md)`

    > This design is only embodied on the command line: `summarymd status`or `summarymd-s`, if used in the project module, the corresponding return value can be obtained by `._summaryStatus_hasProblems().problem_with_URL` and `._summaryStatus_hasProblems().problem_with_Text`.

## Installation of cable vehicles

1. Install into the project:

    ```bash
    npm i summarymd
    ```
2. Global Installation:

    ```bash
    npm i -g summarymd
    ```
    > Run `summarymd-h`after global installation to get command line support functions and usage.



## Usage

### 1. Introduce to the project.

```js
const summarymd = require ('summarymd')

const SM = new summarymd ()// must use with new

// change configs

// When creating a file, use the name of the file as the first-level title of the document.

SM.configs.confs_with_create.isUseFileBasenameAsTitle = true;


// Use "+" as a list tag.

SM.configs.confs_with_summary.listSing='+';

//... You can change more configuration items to create files or create temporary directories



// Create a markdown file from the summary file.

SM.create ((t)=> {return `# ${t} \n [TOC] `})

/** After the file is created, the contents are similar:

# Example
  
[TOC]

 */

SM.update ()// Generate temporary directories.

```

### 2. Global installation, used as a command.

> There are many configuration items, so it's troublesome to use command parameters alone. We use configuration files to deal with how to create files and how to update temporary directories.

* First, create the configuration file to the project work path (`summaryConfig. js'):

    ```bash
    Summymd init
    ```
    > If you want to reset the configuration file, execute `summarymd reinit`.

* Next, change the configuration file and save it according to your needs, such as setting indentation, list tags, document template functions, etc.

* After completing the first two steps, you can now work with commands:

    ```bash
    Summarymd create
    ```
    > Create a file.

    ```bash
    Summymd update
    ```
    > Update the temporary directory with update.
    ```bash
    Summary Watch
    ```
    > Watch automatically monitors file changes and automatically executes `summarymd create` and `summarymd update`.

### 1. Project references are used by the new keyword, and then reassigned to the specified configuration item.

Source code:

```js

this.configs={

    // Files to be processed (Path completion, even if "./SUMMARY.md" and "SUMMARY.md" are equivalent, but must be written as "./SUMMARY.md")

    include: ['./**/*.md','./**/*.markdown'],
    // Formal directory file path (path to be completed, even if "./SUMMARY.md" and "SUMMARY.md" are equivalent, but must be written as "./SUMMARY.md")
    summary: "./SUMMARY.md",

    // Configuration of Creating Files
    confs_with_create:{ 

        // Whether to use the file name as the document title.
        isUseFileBasename AsTitle: false,

        // Remote path matching expressions (remote files cannot be created, you can try to download them if you can, but they can only be excluded here)
        remoteURLregexp: /(\w\:\/|(\.\.\/)|(\:\\\\)|(\w+\:\d+)|\~\/|(\d.+\.\d).[\/|\:\?]?)|((\w\.[\w|\d]).*\/.+([\/]|\:\d|\.html|\.php|\.jsp|\.asp|\.py))/g
    },

    // Update Temporary Directory Configuration
    confs_with_summary:{

        // Temporary directory file path (path to be completed, even if "./SUMMARY.md" and "SUMMARY.md" are equivalent, but must be written as "./SUMMARY.md")
        tempSummary: ". /_summary. md",

        // Does the file name serve as the text of the link to the directory list?
        isUseBFasLinkText: false,

        // List Markup Symbol
        listSing: "*",

        // Whether to code links
        isEncodeURI: false,

        // Configuration of directory list indentation
        indent: {
            // Whether to use indentation or not.
            isIndent: true,

            // indentation length
            indentLength: 4,

            // indent by "IndentByDirs" or "IndentByTitle"

            /**
             *
             * It must be in this format (both IndentByDirs and IndentByTitle):
             * @example
             *
             * [{basis:/\/js\//,times:1},...]
             *
             * key:  basis - The indentation rule, preferably a regular expression, is used in the code to test whether the indentation rule matches with the "basis.test()".
             * 
             * key: Times - The number of indentations must be numeric, and the final indentation = .indentLength * times .
             *
             * Note:
             *
             * IndentByDirs and IndentByTitle cannot be defined simultaneously. Define one, and the other should be null.
             */
            IndentByDirs: null,
            /**@see IndentByDirs*/
            IndentByTitle: null,
        }
    }
}

// Documents to be excluded.

this.excludes = ['!./node_modules/**/*. *','!'+this.configs.summary,'!'+this.configs.confs_with_summary.tempSummary]

```

### 2. Configuration instructions as command line usage

The configuration file is generated by:  `summarymd init`. The generated file is: `./summaryConfig.js`. It's contents are as follows:

```js
Const confs={

    // You can add more properties if you need (Different from defaults). But don't del the default properties (you can change the value).

    // Why not JSON? For the summary module, you can redefine anything and use JavaScript files to customiz

    template: "# %title%",// it's just a default string ,you can do more. the "%title%" will be replaced by true title. 
    includes: ['./**/*.md', './**/*.markdown'],
    excludes:['!./node_modules/**/*.*'],
    summary: "./SUMMARY.md",
    confs_with_create: {
        isUseFileBasenameAsTitle: false,
        remoteURLregexp: /(\w\:\/|(\.\.\/)|(\:\\\\)|(\w+\:\d+)|\~\/|(\d.+\.\d).[\/|\:\?]?)|((\w\.[\w|\d]).*\/.+([\/]|\:\d|\.html|\.php|\.jsp|\.asp|\.py))/g,
        },
    confs_with_summary: {
        tempSummary: "./_summary.md",
        isUseBFasLinkText: false,
        listSing: "*",
        isEncodeURI: false,
        indent: {
            isIndent: true,
            indentLength: 4,
            IndentByDirs: null,
            IndentByTitle: null,
        }
    }
}
module.exports = {
    confs
}
```

It's similar to the module reference method, just to redefine the default values as simply as possible and make some changes... Anyway, it feels very complicated! Configuration files in JSON format are not easy to use variant additions —— especially when creating new documents in batches, such as date and time. In comparison, it is better to deploy a temporary NPM project directly than to use the command line...
